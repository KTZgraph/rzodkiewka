This can also occur between different character sets. For example, the Latin capital letter \"A\" and the Greek capital letter \"\u0391\" (Alpha) are treated as distinct by programs, but may be displayed in exactly the same way to a user. Accent marks may also cause letters to appear very similar, such as the Latin capital letter grave mark \"\u00c0\" and its equivalent \"\u00c0\" with the acute accent."

Therefore, the chipmaker must place a certain level of trust with the OSAT. To counter this, the chipmaker often requires the OSAT partner to enter into restrictive non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Nonetheless, OSAT vendors likely have many customers, which increases the risk of accidental sharing of information.

However, Seven\n        Pernicious Kingdoms also has a \"Path Manipulation\" phrase that\n        is for external control of pathnames (CWE-73), which is a\n        factor in symbolic link following and path traversal, neither\n        of which is explicitly mentioned in 7PK. Fortify uses the\n        phrase \"Often Misused: Path Manipulation\" for a broader range\n        of problems, generally for issues related to buffer\n        management. Given the multiple conflicting uses of this term,\n        there is a chance that CWE users may have incorrectly mapped\n        to this entry.\n\n\tThe second reason for deprecation is an implied combination of\n\tmultiple weaknesses within buffer-handling functions. The\n\tfocus of this entry was generally on the path-conversion\n\tfunctions and their association with buffer\n\toverflows. However, some of Fortify's Vulncat entries have the\n\tterm \"path manipulation\" but describe a non-overflow weakness\n\tin which the buffer is not guaranteed to contain the entire\n\tpathname, i.e., there is information truncation (see CWE-222\n\tfor a similar concept). A new entry for this non-overflow\n\tweakness may be created in a future version of CWE.",

        "extendedDescription": "IP addresses can be easily spoofed. Attackers can forge the source IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication."

However, there is nothing in the HTTP protocol itself that actually prevents the HTTP GET method from performing more than just query of the data. Developers can easily code programs that accept a HTTP GET request that do in fact create, update or delete data on the server.

For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.
